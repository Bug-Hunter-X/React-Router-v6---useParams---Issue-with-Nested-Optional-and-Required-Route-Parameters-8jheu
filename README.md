This repository demonstrates a bug and its solution related to using useParams() in React Router v6 with nested routes containing both optional and required parameters. The bug occurs when an optional parameter in a parent route is missing, causing a child route with a required parameter to not receive its value correctly. The solution provides a method to handle this scenario.
